# College Management System (Part of my course SEM-3 project for the subject Object Oriented Programming)

This is a C++ project that models a college system. The project includes a `college` class that contains information about a college such as its name, address, strength, number of branches, and the names of the branches.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires a C++ compiler. If you're using Windows, you might want to install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). For Linux and MacOS, the GCC compiler is usually pre-installed.

## Usage

This project can be used as a base for developing a more comprehensive college management system.
